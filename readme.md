# HTML Mail Template - Built for Outlook 

An HTML mail template built on a no-rubbish design principle limiting the amount of code to the bare minimum in order to prevent as many flaws as possible.
Due to the incredible inconsistency in mail clients and the way they render HTML.

Known Issues:

- Outlook Web Apps: The underline on links in the previewer is browser dependant due the way the preprocessor handles the code. It's impossible to remove them.
